# Snake_Game
*  This is a snake game made using Java Swing and Awt. The rules are same as that of the original snake game - eat the apple to increase your length, and if your snake hits either of the boundaries or eats itself, then GAME OVER!!!

*  Create a folder named Icons in the folder where your source code is present. In your Icons folder keep the images
